# Speech to Text Android App

> ðŸ¤– This project was entirely developed by AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) in an interactive pair programming session.

A HAL 9000-inspired Android app that records speech, converts it to text using Android's built-in speech recognition, and sends the text along with a PIN to a specified endpoint.
